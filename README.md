# Assignment 1 - Natural Language Processing

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of a spell correction system using the Minimum Edit Distance (MED) algorithm. The project evaluates the performance of the MED algorithm using the WordNet dictionary and the Birkbeck spelling error corpus.

## Project Description
The primary goal of this project is to assess the effectiveness of the MED algorithm in identifying and correcting spelling errors. By leveraging the WordNet dictionary and the Birkbeck corpus, the project explores the algorithm's accuracy in various spell correction scenarios.

## Features
- Implementation of the Minimum Edit Distance algorithm.
- Integration with the WordNet dictionary for comprehensive word comparisons.
- Evaluation using the Birkbeck spelling error corpus.
- Performance metrics for different accuracy thresholds (s@1, s@5, s@10).
